    <p>

        I am currently working as a high school GED teacher at the Robert E. Burton Adult School at San Quentin State
        Prison. It has been a very challenging but quite rewarding experience to teach older incarcerated teens and
        adults.
        In addition to my main subject, English, I had to learn and teach new areas of subject matter, including the
        entire
        mathematics curriculum, as well as a myriad of new online procedures. However, I feel that now that I am
        familiar
        with and knowledgeable about the new curricula and procedures, I can get back to the joy of teaching!
    </p>





    <h2>II. Developing as a Professional Educator</h2>

    <p>Initial CTSP Assessments vs. Post Assessments:</p>

    <p>CSTP 3: Understanding and Organizing Subject Matter for Student Learning</p>
    <p>Element 3.1: Demonstrating knowledge of subject matter, academic content standards, curriculum frameworks</p>

    <p>Initial Assessment: Level 5: I was, until this year, only teaching English or remedial English, so I felt very
        confident in my knowledge of subject matter.</p>

    <p>Final Assessment: Level 4: Since I was required to suddenly teach three other subjects-- primarily math, but also
        social studies and science-- I had to learn the material to feel strong and confident in teaching those
        subjects.
        Even in my specialty, language arts, I had to create a curriculum that was:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>comprehensive preparation for the GED RLA test</li>
        <li>accessible to all students</li>
        <li>of high interest to younger and older incarcerated men</li>
    </ol>

    <p>To satisfy these requirements, I created a “multi-faceted” approach by using supplemental books that nicely
        complemented the required text, which was Common Core Achieve (McGraw-Hill). See the list below:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Advanced Word Power (Townsend Press) for vocabulary-building</li>
        <li>Kaplan: GED Prep Plus 2022-2023 (Simon & Schuster) for readings and analysis</li>
        <li>Various collections of stories of high interest, such as The Richest Man in Babylon (Plume/Penguin)</li>
        <li>Straight Forward Math (Garlic Press)</li>
    </ol>

    <p><i>The Richest Man in Babylon</i> had stories that were not only entertaining and educational, but were also good
        sources
        of sophisticated academic vocabulary. The Straightforward Math series was a great option when students needed
        more
        scaffolding and practice problems in graphing linear equations, square roots, polynomials, and quadratic
        equations.
        I felt I learned a lot about which texts were successful and which were not. The texts mentioned above were
        found,
        through trial and error, to be the most effective.</p>

    <p>
        CSTP 2: Creating and Maintaining Effective Environments for Student Learning
        Element 2.4: Creating a rigorous learning environment with high expectations and appropriate support for all
        students.
    </p>

    <p>
        Initial Assessment: Level 4: I wasn't sure how to "draw out" several students in my class who seemed as if they
        had
        had many negative experiences in school and were overly cautious about answering questions or, indeed, asking
        questions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Final Assessment: Level 5: I utilized "wait time" and "talk moves" to give students more time to formulate
        answers
        and to reflect on topics at hand. Using these techniques helped students, especially the shy ones, to
        participate
        more in discussions and to ask more questions. In RLA, this was most evident when students gave more focused
        answers
        on questions involving an author's thesis or point of view. In math, the positive effects of these techniques
        were
        evident when students were able to participate in solving problems or explaining solutions.
    </p>

    <p> CSTP 6: Developing as a Professional Educator</p>
    <p>
        Element 6.3: Collaborating with colleagues and the broader professional community to support teacher and student
        learning
    </p>

    <p>Initial Assessment: Level 3: Since I was completely new to the job, I had to rely on all my colleagues to learn
        the
        substance of the material in three new subjects as well as procedures for attendance-taking, grade reporting,
        behavior reporting, etc. It was quite challenging, as stated in the Introduction, but once learned, all became
        smooth and almost easy!</p>

    <p>
        Final Assessment: Level 4: I interpreted this standard as the basis for my learning effective teaching
        approaches
        with incarcerated students from other teachers. I also saw the "support teacher learning" part as an opportunity
        to
        teach my TAs effective teaching techniques, such as "showing, not telling," and asking the more timid students
        questions that the teacher knows the student can answer. Another idea from other colleagues that was
        particularly
        helpful was the practice of starting out the lesson with a quick review of a previous type of problem. This
        approach
        fits in perfectly with the "open entry, open exit" structure of our curriculum.

    </p>

    <p>CSTP 5: Assessing Students for Learning</p>
    <p>
        Element 5.1: Applying knowledge of the purposes, characteristics, and uses of different types of assessments
    </p>

    <p>
        Initial Assessment: Level 4: I was not sure if I should spend more time on practice materials in both RLA and
        math
        or on practice tests in those subjects in preparation for taking the "real" GED test.
    </p>

    <p>
        Final Assessment: Level 5: Students were informally assessed in class by having individuals solve and explain
        the
        steps in analyzing texts or solving math problems. Students were assessed formally by taking the Aztec practice
        tests and the GED Ready tests as formative assessments and the GED exam as the summative assessment.
    </p>

    <p>
        After many months of testing, I decided that the multi-faceted approach was the best. The students that came to
        the
        face-to-face class, then practiced problems online, and then took many formative practice tests were the most
        successful in passing the GED exam on the first or second try. Those who did not take many practice tests often
        had
        to take the GED multiple times (on average 5 times) in order to pass.
    </p>

    <p>
        One very effective test-taking technique that the students liked very much was the lesson on how to eliminate
        wrong
        answers on standardized tests so they could narrow down the possible answers to choose from. They found this
        approach to be helpful in not only picking correct answers, but also in saving time.
    </p>

    <p> CSTP 3: Understanding and Organizing Subject Matter for Student Learning
    </p>
    <p>Element 3.2: Applying knowledge of student development and proficiencies to ensure student understanding of
        subject
        matter.</p>

    <p>
        Initial Assessment: Level 4: I wasn't sure that just being "a good teacher" would be enough to cut through the
        students' many years of negative classroom experience. Therefore, I decided to try to be as consistent and
        positive
        as possible in our routines and procedures in order to give students the confidence that they could trust
        me--and
        that my goal was their success.
    </p>

    <p>
        Final Assessment: Level 4: As stated previously, I was teaching mainly English and math this last year. I also
        helped students read and interpret the material in social studies and science. Since most of the "expected
        knowledge" of social studies and science depended upon reading texts and recalling information with some
        analysis
        (DOK levels 1-2), I stressed the need for students to keep coming to the class presentations on English and math
        because these subjects took more time to absorb. English required much analysis, and math required more
        problem-solving, but both required more time to "sink in" as opposed to the other subjects. This was the case
        for
        the intellectual development of most students beyond the simple "recall" stage.
    </p>

    <p>
        In English, my annotation technique was particularly effective in helping students focus on an author's main
        idea,
        purpose, audience, and point of view, for example. In math, my technique to have students explain the "why" of
        every
        single step contributed to their deeper understanding of the problem at hand.
    </p>


    <h2>
        III. How I Contributed to the Profession
    </h2>

    <p>
        One of the ways I contributed to the profession was by creating educational "pods." Two of those pods involved
        annotating and eliminating the "wrong" answers on standardized tests, such as the GED. For annotation, I created
        a
        protocol for quick and accurate annotation. The three rules for students to think about while doing annotation
        were:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>underline or circle key or unfamiliar words</li>
        <li>look for main idea of paragraph</li>
        <li>write no more than 3-5 words in the margin if possible</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        We practiced this technique with several reading samples from our Common Core and Kaplan GED Preparation books,
        and
        the students found it to be quite helpful. The comments were that it was "easy" and "fast." This was the purpose
        of
        this approach because too many students think of annotation as "hard extra work" and something to be avoided.
        The second protocol had to do with recognizing the patterns of and eliminating "wrong" answers on standardized
        tests. The students were given a list of common "wrong" answer types, listed below:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>answer is too narrow or limited</li>
        <li>answer is too broad or vague</li>
        <li>answer is true, but not stated in the article</li>
        <li>answer is an assumption</li>
        <li>two answers are almost identical</li>
    </ol>

    <p> Again we used reading selections from our Common Core and Kaplan GED preparation books, which had writings on a
        variety of contemporary issues, such as the continued use of fossil fuels or the banning of smoking in
        restricted
        areas. The students really enjoyed this unit because they felt quite empowered to take the GED test
        successfully.
        They even told me they started to use this "elimination" technique for standardized tests in other classes as
        well--
        with great results!</p>

    <p>

        Another way I impact my students is by encouraging constant discussions about the value of education and the
        choices
        it gives a person. We talk about how someone with language skills, for example, has a good chance of succeeding
        as a
        teacher, a lawyer, a politician, or a business person. A person with math skills has a good chance of succeeding
        as
        a computer technician, an engineer, a doctor, a scientist, a teacher, or a business person as well. And an
        individual with both types of skills could have success in most any profession.
